# Okada (1992) Scripts in Python
Last updated Sept 24 2024

This is a Python version of [FORTRAN scripts](https://www.bosai.go.jp/e/txt/DC3Dfortran.txt) that describe internal deformation due to shear and tensile faults in a half-space. This code allows for any system to run it without the need of a FORTRAN compiler, so long as Python and NumPy are installed. Proper usage to be described.
